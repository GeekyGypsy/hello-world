# hello-world
yet another introductory repository


GeekyGypsy here. In college for web development/design. I've tinkered with web development for awhile but never thought to really do anything with it - had always gravitated to healthcare, and for a long time that's what I did. Last year, some not so good things happened but in the mist of it all, I was given an opportunity to go back to school to learn a different trade, hence why I'm here. :)
